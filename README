Cornflakes
==========

A simple HTML5 output generator for PyFlakes

This simple tool is based upon PyFlakes and uses AWK to transform the output of
the former to a simple HTML5 page.

The usage is simple and at the moment no options are allowed. To generate the
HTML report for a given file/directory, simply use:

   cornflakes file|directory [output_file]

were would you have used 

   pyflakes file|directory
   

As a further constraint over the original pyflakes script, cornflakes does not
parse multiple arguments; this means that only the first file/directory are
processed.

The results of the processing are saved in the file specified by the output_file
argument if specified or outputted to stdout.

You have also to copy the master.css file to the directory containing the output
file (this will be improved in future versions).

For an example of the output look at the "sample" folder.

TODOs
=====

 * Add multiple file parsing capability
 * Add some options to define the output file, css inlining, template,...
 * Remove temporary files (or remove the need for them)
 * Copy the styles (if not inlined) to the specifed output directory
 * Imrpove compatibility for non-webkit browsers
